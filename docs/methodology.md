## Energy model

Energy consumption is estimated as a function of:
- total number of processed tokens
- model size and architecture
- inference reasoning complexity
- architecture efficiency (dense vs MoE)

Per-model energy measurements are not publicly available.
This project uses architecture-based scaling factors derived from
academic literature and public infrastructure disclosures.
