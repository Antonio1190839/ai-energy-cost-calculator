# Methodology

This calculator estimates the energy and carbon cost of AI inference.

## Scope
- Inference only (no model training)
- Average energy consumption per token
- Publicly available carbon intensity data

## Assumptions
- Energy per 1k tokens is an order of magnitude
- Infrastructure efficiency varies
- Results are estimates, not measurements
