# AI Energy Cost Calculator

An open-source project estimating the **energy consumption** and **carbon footprint**
of AI inference workloads.

## Why this exists
AI feels immaterial. It is not.
This project makes its physical cost visible.

## What it provides
- Energy estimates (Wh / kWh)
- CO₂ emissions estimates (g / kg)
- Explicit assumptions
- Reproducible calculations

## Disclaimer
All results are estimates, not measurements.
